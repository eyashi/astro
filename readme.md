# ~ Astro ~

This will a small visual display of planetary position data.
It uses concepts from astrology, astronomy, and crystal chemistry to seed the
visualization.

I hope to use the simple Pyxel game engine to drive the visuals. Reason being
I'd eventually like some interactivity with the interface. Something you can
'explore.'

To install:  
`git clone` this repo  
`cd` into said repo  
`pip install requirements.txt`  
`python astro.py` to be guided through the setup for the first time  

`python astro.py --setup` if you need to reconfigure later  

Bless.
